									<h1>Headstarter Fellowship Programme</h1>
									<a class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>It was a tired afternoon when a discord notification popped up, a good friend of mine had sent me a link to register for a fellowship. At the time it collided with my internship and was doubting whether I had time for it so I had left it. A week later he further pushed the idea and I realised that I had to take the jump of doing something out of my comfort zone and I registered, at first I doubted whether I would have gotten in yet as the wave of acceptances arrived due to my late application all my peers got in yet I was still waiting. To my suprise I had gotten in and here I am now making a website admitidly a couple hours before my deadline. I'll admit it is very hard to juggle these type of things with my 9-5 internship but I agree sometimes taking the extra step can benefit you deeply in life. I am very thankful for Yasin Ehsan and everyone who has assisted in providing this wonderful opportunity.</p>
