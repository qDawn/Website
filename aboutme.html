									<h1>Who am I?</h1>
									<a class="image main"><img src="images/pic06.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>My name is Ling Guo, I live in the United Kingdom and some day I aspire to be a full-stack engineer, growing up in the technological age I had access to the internet early on. I believe my passion for technology began during Covid-19, the global pandemic may have halted everyones work. Yet I was not going to be like the rest of them. I had goals and dreams of being a professional developer yet I was unsure what exactly I wanted to be. At the age of 13 I self-taught myself python utilising free resources such as YouTube and Stack Overflow as I didn't have facilities for paid services(Shout out Bro Code). Growing up I needed challenge, subjects such as Mathematics I found intriguing and always wanted a problem I couldn't solve, the whole aspect of problem-solving intrigued me as a fond enjoyer of puzzles I took it upon myself to push to be someone who would know it all. Hence why I wish to become a full-stack developer. Very recently there has been huge amounts of lay offs in companies regarding tech roles and I believe that this just makes me work harder for my dreams and hopefully, someday start my own business regarding tech.</p>
